Statement
Given a positive integer k and a sequence of coin flip results, find the longest continuous subsequence containing exactly k times more heads than tails.
H = Head
T = Tail
Example:
- K = 2 HTHHTHHHHHTH

Hint:
Given an array, positive and negative. Find the longest array which the sum of all the items is zero

For example:  [5, 1, 0, 2, -3, 4, 2]
    - Solutions Position between 1 and 4 [1, 0, 2, -3]
